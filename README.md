# 🤣 Random Joke Generator

A simple and fun web app that displays random jokes using an external API. This project helped me practice working with APIs, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and building responsive, interactive interfaces.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Responsive + Animations)
- JavaScript (Fetch API, DOM manipulation, event handling)
- [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) (for fetching jokes)
